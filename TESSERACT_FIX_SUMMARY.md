# Tesseract PATH Issue - FIXED âœ“

## Problem
Tesseract was installed, but not in the system PATH, causing this error:
```
Error processing frame: tesseract is not installed or it's not in your PATH
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Auto-Detection in PokerVideoAnalyzer
Updated `poker_video_analyzer.py` to automatically detect Tesseract in common installation locations:
- `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`
- `C:\Users\Julia\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`

### 2. Auto-Detection in MainPokerAnalyzer
Updated `main_poker_analyzer.py` to:
- Import `find_tesseract()` from config module
- Automatically find and pass Tesseract path to the analyzer
- Show clear error if Tesseract not found

### 3. Verification
All components now work correctly:
- âœ“ `check_setup.py` - Confirms Tesseract found
- âœ“ `test_ocr.py` - OCR working without errors
- âœ“ `test_quick_analysis.py` - Frame processing working
- âœ“ `main_poker_analyzer.py` - Ready for full analysis

## Current Status

**All systems operational!**

```
Tesseract: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
Status: Detected and working correctly
```

## Running the Analyzer

You can now run the full analysis without any PATH issues:

### Option 1: Direct Python
```bash
python main_poker_analyzer.py
```

### Option 2: Batch Launcher
```bash
run_analyzer.bat
```

### Option 3: With Custom Options
```bash
# Faster processing (every 15 frames)
python main_poker_analyzer.py --sample-rate 15

# With debug frames
python main_poker_analyzer.py --debug

# Custom video
python main_poker_analyzer.py "path/to/video.mp4"
```

## What Was Changed

### Files Modified:
1. **poker_video_analyzer.py** (lines 77-94)
   - Added Tesseract auto-detection
   - Added informative messages

2. **main_poker_analyzer.py** (lines 14, 351-358, 365-374)
   - Import `find_tesseract` from config
   - Auto-detect Tesseract in `main()` function
   - Auto-detect Tesseract in `__main__` section

### Files Created for Testing:
1. **test_ocr.py** - Quick OCR functionality test
2. **test_quick_analysis.py** - Quick frame processing test

## No Manual PATH Configuration Needed!

You **do not** need to:
- Add Tesseract to Windows PATH manually
- Set environment variables
- Modify system settings

The analyzer now handles everything automatically!

## Future Runs

Every time you run the analyzer, it will:
1. Automatically detect Tesseract location
2. Configure pytesseract to use it
3. Show which Tesseract executable is being used
4. Process your video without errors

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

### 1. Verify Installation
```bash
python check_setup.py
```
Should show:
```
Tesseract OCR:    [OK]
```

### 2. Test OCR
```bash
python test_ocr.py
```
Should complete without errors.

### 3. Quick Analysis Test
```bash
python test_quick_analysis.py
```
Should process 10 frames successfully.

### 4. Check Tesseract Path Manually
If installed in a different location, edit `config.py` and add your path to `TESSERACT_ALTERNATIVES`:
```python
TESSERACT_ALTERNATIVES = [
    r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe",
    r"C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe",
    r"C:\Your\Custom\Path\tesseract.exe",  # Add your path here
]
```

## Ready to Analyze!

Everything is now working correctly. You can proceed with the full video analysis:

```bash
python main_poker_analyzer.py
```

This will:
- Process all frames from your Spin & Go video
- Extract player information, actions, and results
- Store everything in `poker_data.db`
- Generate `poker_analysis_report.txt`
- Export hands to `poker_hands.json`

Estimated processing time: ~5-10 minutes (depending on your CPU)

## What to Expect

During processing you'll see:
```
Using Tesseract: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
Processing video: C:\Users\Julia\Downloads\Spin_and_Go.mp4
Total frames: 13269, FPS: 30.0
Resolution: 1280x720

Step 1: Processing video frames...
Processed 10 frames (300/13269)
Processed 20 frames (600/13269)
...
```

The analyzer will process every 30th frame by default (about 442 frames total).

Enjoy your poker analysis! ðŸŽ°
